# ðŸŒŠ Flood Probability Prediction using Regression

This project aims to predict flood probability using regression models based on environmental and hydrological data. The models are evaluated using common regression metrics: MAE, MSE, and RÂ².

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Floods are one of the most frequent natural disasters that threaten both rural and urban areas. This project builds a machine learning model to estimate the probability of flooding, which can be useful for early warning systems or urban planning.

## ðŸ“Š Models Used

| Model                     | MAE     | MSE     | RÂ²       |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Lars**                 | 0.8065  | 0.9982  | 0.0008   |
| **Linear Regression**    | 0.3291  | 0.1713  | 0.8285   |
| **GradientBoostingRegressor** | 0.5127  | 0.3805  | 0.6191   |

From the results, **Linear Regression** performed best with the lowest error and highest RÂ² score.

## ðŸ§  Features
